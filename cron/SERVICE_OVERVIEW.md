## Key Features Implemented

### Backup System
- **Encrypted Backups**: All database backups are encrypted using GPG
- **Integrity Verification**: Automatic verification of backup file integrity
- **Retention Management**: Configurable retention period for old backups
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Monitoring System
- **API Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of backend API health
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Automatic detection and alerting for low inventory
- **Backup Status Tracking**: Monitoring of backup age and integrity
- **Disk Space Monitoring**: Alerts for low disk space conditions

### Scheduling System
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Configurable backup and maintenance schedules
- **Multiple Execution Modes**: Direct execution, cron daemon, or one-time tasks
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health check endpoints
- **Restart Policies**: Automatic restart on failure

### Security Features
- **Non-root Execution**: Service runs as non-root user
- **Encrypted Storage**: All sensitive data is encrypted
- **Secure Permissions**: Proper file permissions (600 for sensitive files)
- **Environment Isolation**: Secure environment variable handling

## Integration with Main System

### Docker Compose Integration
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` with proper cron service configuration
- Health check integration
- Volume mounting for data persistence
- Network connectivity with backend service

### API Integration
- Direct integration with InvGuard backend API
- JWT token handling for secure communication
- Health check endpoints
- Analytics data access for monitoring

### Database Integration
- Direct access to SQLite database for backup operations
- Integration with existing backup utilities
- Transaction-safe backup operations

## Usage Examples

### Start the Service
```bash
# Using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Manual execution
python backup_cron.py

# One-time backup
python backup_cron.py backup

# Health check
python backup_cron.py health
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Generate health report
python monitor.py report

# Check service logs
docker logs invguard_cron

# View backup files
ls -la /app/backups/
```

## Configuration

The service is fully configurable through environment variables:

- `DATABASE_PATH`: Path to SQLite database
- `BACKUP_PATH`: Backup storage directory
- `GPG_PASSPHRASE`: Encryption passphrase
- `API_URL`: Backend API URL
- `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`: Backup retention period
- `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL`: Health check frequency

## Security Considerations

- All backups are encrypted with GPG
- Service runs as non-root user
- Secure file permissions
- Environment variable isolation
- Health check authentication

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Comprehensive logging to `/app/logs/`
- Health check endpoints
- Alert thresholds for various conditions
- Integration with notification systems (extensible)

## Maintenance

- Automatic cleanup of old backups
- Disk space monitoring
- Service health monitoring
- Configurable retention policies

The InvGuard Cron Service is now a complete, production-ready backup and monitoring solution that integrates seamlessly with the existing InvGuard inventory management system.
